            <p>Ensuring the safety and integrity of user data and assets.</p>
        </header>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Core Security Principles</h2>
            <p>The security of the QuantumTrade platform is paramount. Our architecture and development practices are guided by the principles of least privilege, defense-in-depth, and secure-by-design.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. API Key Management</h2>
            <p>Proper management of API keys is critical for the security of AI interactions and future exchange integrations.</p>
            
            <h3>2.1 Gemini API Key</h3>
            <div class="alert">
                <strong>Crucial:</strong> The Gemini API key is handled as a build-time environment variable (<code>process.env.API_KEY</code>). It is <strong>never</strong> exposed in the client-side code, stored in browser local storage, or requested from the user via a UI input field. This approach ensures that the key remains confidential and is only used by the application's backend services (simulated by Vite's build process in this demo).
            </div>
            
            <h3>2.2 Exchange API Keys (Future)</h3>
            <p>For future integration with exchanges like Binance or Bybit:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keys will be stored in a secure, encrypted backend vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS).</li>
                <li>Users will be strongly advised to create API keys with restricted permissions, allowing only trading and portfolio reading, with withdrawals disabled.</li>
                <li>All API key entry and transmission will occur over encrypted HTTPS connections.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Data Protection</h2>
            
            <h3>3.1 Data in Transit</h3>
            <p>All communication between the user's browser and our servers (and subsequently to third-party APIs like Gemini) must be encrypted using industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or higher. The application will enforce HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
            
            <h3>3.2 Data at Rest</h3>
            <p>User-specific configuration and sensitive data (such as linked exchange accounts in the future) will be encrypted at rest in our backend databases using AES-256 encryption.</p>
            
            <h3>3.3 Client-Side Storage</h3>
            <p>Non-sensitive user preferences (e.g., theme, language) are stored in the browser's <code>localStorage</code>. No sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, is ever stored on the client side.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. User Authentication & Authorization</h2>
            
            <h3>4.1 Authentication</h3>
            <p>The current application uses a simulated Google OAuth flow for login. In a production environment, this will be a full OAuth 2.0 implementation, ensuring that we never handle or store user passwords directly. This delegates the primary authentication responsibility to a trusted provider like Google.</p>

            <h3>4.2 Session Management</h3>
            <p>Secure, short-lived session tokens (e.g., JSON Web Tokens - JWTs) will be used to manage user sessions after login. These tokens will be transmitted via secure HTTP-only cookies to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.</p>

            <h3>4.3 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>
            <p>A planned feature on our roadmap is the implementation of mandatory 2FA (via TOTP apps like Google Authenticator) for all accounts to provide an additional layer of security against unauthorized access.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Compliance</h2>
            <p>As QuantumTrade evolves, we are committed to adhering to relevant financial and data protection regulations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GDPR & CCPA:</strong> We will design our data handling practices to be compliant with major data privacy regulations, ensuring users have control over their personal information.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Regulations:</strong> While QuantumTrade is a tool and not a brokerage, we will remain aware of regulations concerning financial advice and algorithmic trading. All AI-generated content will be clearly marked as such and will include disclaimers that it does not constitute financial advice.</li>
            </ul>
